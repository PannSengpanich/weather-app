# weather-app

The Weather App project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Course. It is a weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter a city name and view the current weather and 7-day forecast for that location.

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional weather application that fetches data from the [weather api](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and displays it to the user in a readable format. This project will help developers to practice their JavaScript programming skills, understand how to make HTTP requests using fetch, and manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
